We choose this topic because data science is our shared major. Over the last ten years, data science has progressed considerably. Data science is an enthralling, lucrative, and rapidly expanding discipline. Data scientists organize and analyze enormous amounts of information, look for trends, and make predictions. Data science majored students are required in nearly every field, including business, finance, science, health, and government. As students who are looking for a position in job market, the first thing concerning us is the salary of a job position. As a data science student, we are interested in learning the salary patterns in different data science positions. We do so with the techniques we learned in class.
