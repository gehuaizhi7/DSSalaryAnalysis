As we can see from the form, most of the values under “easy apply” and “competitor” labels are missing. That means we should avoid to investigate the relation of salary and these two features. Among all features, “Sectors”, “Industry”, and “number of employees” are least missing values. Thus, we want to investigate more about relations of these features and salary level. 4.2 display first ten company The following missing pattern graph shows the pattern of missing values. Blue represents data that are missing, while gray represents data that are not missing. We can find out from the map that “revenue”, “competitors”, and “year founded” have most missing value in the dataset. Besides this, we also find out that there is no correlation between features that are missing, that is, no feature leads to other features’ data missing. Therefore, we can investigate each feature without being intervened by other feature’s missing data. 4.3 use mi library draw heatmap and check missing value ## NOTE: The following pairs of variables appear to have the same missingness pattern. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;Job Title&quot;

Moreover, ‘Easy.apply’ and ‘Competitors’ are more likely to be missing in the dataset than the other variables. While other values are missing, the values of Company.name, index, Job.Description, Job.Title, Location, Salary.Estimate, and X are all presenting in the dataset. The features Industry and Sector seem to be missing at the same time. The feature Founded seems to be an independent feature, its representing doesn’t effect other feature’s status. Complete cases only appears less than 100 rows while there are more than 2000 rows of data in the set.
