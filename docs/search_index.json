[["index.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction Name: Binghong Yu(by2325), Huanyu Jiang(hj2593), Huaizhi Ge(hg2590) We choose this topic because data science is our shared major. Over the last ten years, data science has progressed considerably. Data science is an enthralling, lucrative, and rapidly expanding discipline. Data scientists organize and analyze enormous amounts of information, look for trends, and make predictions. Data science majored students are required in nearly every field, including business, finance, science, health, and government. As students who are looking for a position in job market, the first thing concerning us is the salary of a job position. As a data science student, we are interested in learning the salary patterns in different data science positions. We do so with the techniques we learned in class. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 data link: https://github.com/picklesueat/data_jobs_data", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 data link: https://github.com/picklesueat/data_jobs_data The data was collected from Glassdoor, an anonymous review service for current and past employees in the United States. On Glassdoor, users may anonymously post and view salaries, as well as search for and apply for jobs. Binghong Yu was responsible for collecting the data. We tried to scrap the website. however the api provided by Glassdoor was taken down and no longer available to the public. As a result, we failed to scrap the website. But we found the scraped data from GitHub, and downloaded it. The dataset is created by picklesueat from Glassdoor. This repo contains four files, including: BusinessAnalyst.csv (4092 * 15), DataAnalyst.csv (5631 * 15), DataEngineer.csv (2528 * 15), and DataScientist.csv (3909 * 15).Each gives information about a branch of data related jobs. For each of them, there are 15 features: ‘Job Title’, ‘Salary Estimate’, ‘Job Description’, ‘Rating’, ‘Company Name’, Location’, ‘Headquarters’, ‘Size’, ‘Founded’, ‘Type of ownership’, ‘Industry’, Sector’, ‘Revenue’, ‘Competitors’, ‘Easy Apply’. There were a few problems with the raw dataset, and we cleaned it so that it could giver much more clear information for the further analysis. First of all, the value of salary feature contains words “GlassDoor estimated”. We only want the actual number of salary, so we deleted the words contained in the salary column and replaced “k”, representing thousands, as “1,000”. Secondly, we modified job titles. For example, some of the job titles contains key words “Jr” and “Sr” while others uses “Junior” and “Senior”. To make the data make more sense, we modified them to have the same representation. We made them follow a certain pattern to give a more clear information. Thirdly, we modified number of employer. For some of the data, number of employers was represented by a range, while others were represented by a specific number. This made the analysis more complicated. We take mean of the range and let the mean to be the new value of this feature "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The data we have are four csv files, which are grouped by four kinds of job titles: data science, data analyst, data engineer and business analyst. However, through scanning the dataset, we found that some of the tags inside the document are incorrect. Thus, the first step we take is through searching keywords inside the job title column and job description column, re-classifying our data. The sequence we labeled them is based on counts of their appearance inside the entire dataset. For instance, a job could both contain keywords for data science and data analyst. However, since data analyst appears more frequently, we tagged this job as data scientist. Meanwhile, we also fix typos and format similar meaning job titles into one, such as ‘Sr. Data scientist’ means the same as ‘Senior Data scientist’. Also, missing values are written in different formats such as “-1”, “not applicable” . They are replaced by NA. In addition, we separate the estimated salary into continuous data form: min_salary, max_salary and mean_salary to better analyze the dataset. Also, the location column is separated into “city” and “state” to be used inside the D3 interactive plot. Here is a list of labels based on keyword search in data title and data description. ## [1] &quot;is_ds_byjd&quot; &quot;is_da_byjt&quot; &quot;is_da_byjd&quot; &quot;is_ba_byjt&quot; ## [5] &quot;is_ba_byjd&quot; &quot;is_de_byjt&quot; &quot;is_de_byjd&quot; &quot;is_ds_byjt&quot; This graph indicates the counts of four types after we reclassify them.

As we can see from the form, most of the values under “easy apply” and “competitor” labels are missing. That means we should avoid to investigate the relation of salary and these two features. Among all features, “Sectors”, “Industry”, and “number of employees” are least missing values. Thus, we want to investigate more about relations of these features and salary level. 4.2 display first ten company The following missing pattern graph shows the pattern of missing values. Blue represents data that are missing, while gray represents data that are not missing. We can find out from the map that “revenue”, “competitors”, and “year founded” have most missing value in the dataset. Besides this, we also find out that there is no correlation between features that are missing, that is, no feature leads to other features’ data missing. Therefore, we can investigate each feature without being intervened by other feature’s missing data. 4.3 use mi library draw heatmap and check missing value ## NOTE: The following pairs of variables appear to have the same missingness pattern. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;Job Title&quot;

So we investigated the job description to find key words of skill sets. From job description, find the frequency of appearance of certain skill sets, such as python, r, pytorch. We used word cloud to represent the frequency of each key word appeared in the sets. The result word could shows us the frequency of each skill required in the data science related jobs. The final result shows us that “R” and “SQL” is the most frequently required skill for all data related jobs. 5.1.1 Box plot for skillset vs salary We want to analyze the relationship between skill set and the salary. If we want to get a high salary, what skill do we need to master? We extract the words about the skill set and take the median of every job that includes the specific words. The boxplot ranks the skills by the median salary. From the graph, we can know that the most paid skills are pytorch, tensorflow and spacy, which are skills about machine learning and natural language processing. It means that if we want to get a high paid job, we need to master the skills of the machine learning. Some skills like excel, database and data visualization appeared frequently in the job description but the median of the job salary including these skills is low. It means that the skills like excel are base skills which are required by most of the jobs. But mastering these skills doesn’t mean getting a high paid job. 5.2 salary vs job title We want to find the relation between salary amount and job titles. We classified all jobs in the dataset into four classes: Business Analyst, Data Analyst, Data Engineer and Data Scientist. Box plot is a great method to get to understand the distribution of salary amount in those four group of employees, as it shows us the mean, fist quantile, last quintile and can also list all outliers. By putting four jobs together, we can compare them and find out which one normally get to be paid more. First of all, DA,DE and DS have the same highest salary, while BA’s highest salary is relatively lower. Secondly, DS job salaries are less concentrated: Data Scientists can be paid very high and also be very low, while Business Analysts normally will not be paid very low, but also can not be too high. Among all job positions, Data Engineers salaries are concentrated at a higher amount. 5.3 Education level vs salary Education level of an employee should be a key factor in their salary amount. We want to verify this guess. We utilized box plot to show salary distribution of jobs that require different education level of their applicants. As shown in the graph, jobs that require applicants PhD degrees normally pay more: their mean, first quantile and last quantile are all higher than the jobs that require master degree or lower. Employees with PhD degree get to be paid 100k per year on avaegae. As a takeaway, applicants are encouraged to pursue higher degrees to get higher paid jobs. On average, PhDs get to be paid more than 20k than employees with lower education degrees. 5.4 Ridge line plot for sector vs salary We want to find out if job salary is affected by industry in which this job belongs. And ridge line is a great choice because it can show us the distribution of salary amount over every industry that the dataset includes. As shown above, the result ridge line shows us salary distribution over 25 high-paid industries such as biotech, media, information technology and so on. They are sorted based on the mean salary amount. Among all industries, Biotech, Media, Arts, Entertainment &amp; Recreation have the highest average salary compared to other industries. While Arts, Entertainment &amp; Recreation having a high average salary, its first quartile is very low. That means a bigger portion of employees in this industry are paid with a very average salary, and a small portion of employees in this industry are very high-paid. Employees in the industry of Information Industry have a very spread-out distribution of salary amount. That means there are many of them being high-paid and there are also many of them being low-paid. Ridge lines of some of the industries, for example Telecommunications, have multiple peaks, meaning that among one industry, there are other key factors to determine an employee’s salary amount. This factor might be company and positions. We will discuss this later in the report. Employees in the industries of Mining, Agricultural, and Non-profit companies get relatively lower amount of salary comparing to others. 5.5 Hex plot for founded year vs salary hex plot We want to find which aspect of companies affect salaries. We guess that year founded of a company will affect salary. We verify this guess by plotting out salary and company year founded on a hex map. We chose this plot because we can easily locate concentration of a set of data on the graph and we can also examine the distribution of peaks over the map. In the result hex map, we found that for BA and DA positions, highest salaries are all provided by companies that are founded in recent years, while for DE and DS positions, this pattern is not as clear as others. We also find out that, for BA and DA positions, salaries in young companies normally tend to concentrate at a same level, as shown as the darker parts in the graph. While for DE and DS, there are hardly darker spots, indicating that the salaries are relatively evenly distributed. 5.6 Cleveland dot plot for Company vs salary We want to know which company pays more to their employees. We classify the employees into four different groups by their job titles, because different job titles apparently will have distinct salary level. We select top 20 companies who pay the most to their employees among all companies in the data set. We use Cleveland dot plot because it shows the difference salary level and also indicates witch jobs title is paid more. As we can see from the plot, Apple, Amazon and IBM pays the most to their employees. Different color dots represents employees in different job titles. We can see from the plot that Data Engineers are normally high paid among all companies listed. And Business Analysts are normally low-paid. In different companies, Data Engineers have very distinct salaries, while Business Analysts and Data Analysts are paid with a concentrated salary amount. 5.7 Glassdoor rating vs salary, wrap by Industry We want to analyze the relationship between rating and salary. In different industry, does high rating company always pay high salary? The rating comes from the users in the Glassdoor. We draw the scatter plot of rating and salary. Every graph represents a job industry, and every color represents a job title. In most of the graphs, rating and salary has a slightly positive correlation, excluding the industries that has few data related jobs. However, some industries have a different situation. For example, in the Real Estate industry, the higher the rating is, the lower the salary is. The reason of this situation may be about our data collection. Glassdoor is a website that everyone can rate and write comments. So, the data is not very authentic. And we can see that different job titles can influence the relationship between rating and salary. For example, in the finance industry, the Data Engineer job salary has a negative correlation with rating but the other three job salary has a slightly positive correlation. So, we come to a conclusion that in the most situation, the high rating comes with a high salary. 5.8 Alluvial plot (Sector, Type of ownership, salary_group) We want to analyze how the sector and the type of ownership influence the salary level as well as the relation of the sector and the type of ownership. Alluvial plots are a form of sankey diagrams that are a great tool for exploring categorical data. They group categorical data into flows that can easily be traced in the diagram. So, we can show the relationship of the three section (“sector”, “type of ownership” and “salary”) clearly. We divided the salary into three groups. If the average salary is larger than 100k dollars, we assume it is “high salary”. If it is less than 70k dollars, we assume it is “low salary”. Otherwise, we assume it is “medium salary”. Alluvial plot shows that the type of ownership of the company has little influence on the salary level. For some type of ownership that account for a small part, they always pay low level of salary. For some sector that account for a small part, most of them pay low level of salary. But Biotech &amp; Pharmaceuticals companies pay high level of salary even they account for a small part. Most high-level paid jobs are in the Information Technology sector, because there are many jobs in the Information Technology companies. Most Business Service companies, and most Information Technology companies are private companies. But most Finance companies are private companies, and all the Biotech &amp; Pharmaceuticals companies are public companies. 5.9 Employee Salary Group VS Company Revenue Level - Mosaic Plot Revenue level of a company can be a very important factor to inspect on the salary of data science related jobs in the job market. Our guess is that for companies that have higher revenue, they pay more salary to their employees. A great way to find out the truth is to use the mosaic plot. A mosaic plot is a sort of stacked bar chart that displays data as percentages in groups. It can show us the contingency table graphically. From the result mosaic graph, we can find out that companies that have higher revenue will tend to have a larger portion of their employees being high paid. And medium revenue companies have the smallest portion of employees being high paid comparing to other companies. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component This interactive component shows the relationship between company location, job title, and salary. The tool is interactive. There are 4 checkboxes on the graph, representing Data Analytics, Data Scientist, Business Analytics, and Data Engineer. If you check the checkbox which represents a job title, the d3 graph will show some circles. Every circle represents a state in the United States. The position in the map of the circle represents the state location. The radius of the circles represent the salary level. The larger the radius is, the higher the average salary is. By checking the checkbox, you can see the salary of every state intuitively. When you move your mouse to a certain circle, it will show a box under the graph including the information about the state name, job type, count, and average salary. Data Analytics jobs are widely demanded. Data Scientist, Business Analytics, and Data Engineer job demands are ditributed on the west side as well as the east side. The salary of the Data Scientist is the highest. The salary of the Data Engineer is the second highest. There is little difference bewteen the salary of the Data Analytics and the Business Analytics. And Business Analytics, and Data Engineer jobs are always demanded together. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion There are several limitations on our study. Most of them are data-related. First of all, we use data provided by Glassdoor, a job-finding website where companies and employees post their advertisements and their resumes. This lead to a problem. The data that we collect could be a bit off from the real situation in the industry. For example, a company may put a higher salary amount on their advertisements while the real salaries are lower. And many of their job descriptions are the minimal qualification needed for this job, but they give offers to applicants who are overqualified. That lead to a problem that the status that we examined might be different from the real situation in the industry. Therefore in the future, we want to collect data from more authentic sources. Corporate Annual Report is a good example. All data provided by their reports are authentic and reliable. After investigating all possible factors provided in the dataset, now we have a clear clue about what make a job high-paid. First of all, jobs in IT, Media and Biotech industries pay more. Secondly, skill sets largely determine the salary level. Some of the high paid jobs require employees to have a good grip of advanced skills such as R, SQL and Machine Learning. Therefore, as job seekers in data related fields are encouraged to pursue a higher degree and try to comprehend as more skills as possible.
