Questions to Resolve:
What are the most significant aspects of a high paid job?
1. Investigate external reasons that determine salaries. What are they? How do they affect salary? Possible factors: industry, company, location.
2. Explore internal factors that determine salaries: what professional skills are necessary? What skills should we acquire to get a higher wage?
3. Job titles: which specific job positions are more prospective?
4. Is there any correlation between demand and salary?

How to Address Questions Using the Data:
1. Calculate the mean, median and mode of salary and find a distribution of salary in data-related jobs.
2. (For question 1) Examine correlations between all categorical data and salary and present it through pair plots and correlation heatmap. Since we proposed that industry, company and location could be the most important factors, we decided to pay special attention to them.
3. (For question 2) For skill requirements, we could extract them from job descriptions by applying the TF-IDF method to analyze the frequency of words.
4. (For question 3) Plot distribution of wages of all job titles. Find median, 75th, and 90th percentile wage. Investigate the shape and skew of the distribution curves. Are they u-shaped or bell-shaped? Are they left-skewed or right skewed?
5. (For question 4) count appearances of each specific job title in the dataset as its demand. Group by companies and industries respectively, we could examine whether there is a connection between job demand and salaries.
